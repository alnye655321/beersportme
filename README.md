## Beerleague.me
### A phonegap android/iOS application
### Description
Currently, coordinating a kickball team for a local league is a practice in disorganization. It involves word-of-mouth recruiting and a combination of SMS and email communication. Our platform will streamline this process. We propose an application that consolidates the experience of recreational, ‘beer-league’ sports.
